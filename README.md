# Testing Automated Release Notes

### Notes

- [actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release) is deprecated (but people still use it).  The project links to other community-maintained workflows but they are not all that popular.
- Release Drafter has a GitHub [App](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter/blob/master/docs/github-app.md) but that's also deprecated, so we're using their GitHub workflow action.
